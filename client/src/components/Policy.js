            <h2 className='sub-heading'>Guidelines</h2>
            <p>If there's one thing we truly love, it's sharing in all the great foodie moments you have. Bouquets when the food exceeds your expectations, brickbats when the service is shocking, chronicles of your food excursions – they all count.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="col-md-10">
            <p>While we welcome your opinions and descriptions of your dining experiences, there are a few things we expect from every user on Zomato. Your reviews and photos, as well as your profile and the comments you share, are all subject to Content Guidelines, our Foodie Code of Conduct.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="col-md-10">
            <p>If your activity on Zomato doesn't match up to these content guidelines, we reserve the right to take action as we deem necessary. This could include altering or deleting your reviews or comments, restricting your review activity or deleting your Zomato account altogether, with or without notice. Zomato also utilizes an algorithm to aid in removing suspicious reviews.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="col-md-10">
            <p>If you see content that does not align with these guidelines or our Terms of Service, please let us know. We will consider all reports. However, due to the diversity of our community, it is possible that content disagreeable to you might not meet the criteria to be removed.</p>

            <h2 className='sub-heading'>Keep out the clutter</h2>
            <p>To make sure we collectively work towards building the highest-quality content that's useful to everyone, reviews need to be a minimum of 140 characters long for dine-in reviews. That's just about the length of a tweet, so it's convenient even for all you micro-bloggers. If you cover the food, service and ambiance, you shouldn't fall short on characters. We do not have a 140 characters limit for an online order review. However, if any review is filled with junk, we might have to remove the review altogether.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="col-md-10">
            <h2 className='sub-heading'>Keep it relevant</h2>
            <p>Please keep your contributions relevant to Zomato. Accounts placing irrelevant, inappropriate or promotional content, reviews with server names, reviews with similar digital signatures that spam restaurants or are based on any already disclaimed or informed policies and practices of a restaurant may be deleted without notice. If your review has been removed or moderated by us and if you repost another experience for the same restaurant, we reserve the right to remove that review too, even though such review might be in line with our content guidelines. In the case of spam, we can restrict your review activity on Zomato.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="col-md-10">
            <h2 className='sub-heading'>Keep it clean</h2>
            <p>Whether you're writing a small snippet or a delightfully detailed account of your meal, keep foul/abusive/hateful language, threats, and lewdness out of it. We, just like you, hate junk and will delete it whenever we see it. This also includes (but is not limited to) derogatory comments on someone's protected characteristics (e.g. race, gender, religion) or indication of a personal vendetta against a business and its associates.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="col-md-10">
            <h2 className='sub-heading'>Keep it fresh</h2>
            <p>Only one review per restaurant for a dine out experience and one review for each online order transaction can be submitted and your most recent experience at a place counts. That's what is going to help people when they're trying to decide whether or not to eat there. You're free to edit and update your review based on subsequent visits at any time. Reviews about old experiences (more than 6 months old) will also be deleted from our platform.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="col-md-10">
            <h2 className='sub-heading'>Keep it real</h2>
            <p>Write your review based on facts and your own experiences (e.g. not a friend's or any hearsay experience or based on media reports). Please don't exaggerate or falsify your experience. We do not take sides in cases of dispute, so make sure you can stand by your word. Content that indicates the reviewer hasn't even visited or availed any services from the restaurant will be removed. For example, "Never been here, never want to. Management is horrible and the food is worse!" Deceptive, fake, or misleading reviews will be removed. Reviewing a bunch of fast-food outlets in quick succession (even if you eat at them more often than you should) is considered suspicious activity, and it's likely these reviews will be moderated. Accepting or soliciting a kickback – monetary or otherwise – in exchange for reviews or photographs is also not acceptable, and could result in removal of your profile.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="col-md-10">
            <h2 className='sub-heading'>Don't solicit</h2>
            <p>Identifying or promoting yourself as an official Zomato blogger, or using your status to solicit any kind of benefits (including but not limited to accepting money, free meals, drinks) in exchange for reviews, or at the threat of negative reviews on Zomato, will not be tolerated. If reports or evidence of such instances are brought to our attention, we reserve the right to delete your Zomato profile or take any other action that we may deem fit, no questions asked. Acts that constitute as 'Solicitation' include:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>Explicit/Implied agreement (written or verbal) to write reviews in exchange for money, a free meal(s), drinks, etc.</li>
              <li>Being a part of social media groups (e.g. WhatsApp/Facebook or any other social media platform) which offer incentives in exchange of reviews.</li>
            </ol>

          </div>
          <div className="col-md-10">
            <h2 className='sub-heading'>Don't steal</h2>
            <p>Plagiarism is something we take seriously. Copying others' reviews or photos from Zomato or other platforms, or even reposting your own in multiple places on Zomato (in full or in part), is something that will not be tolerated and may be removed/ moderated. We trust that you'll play fair and create your own content.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="col-md-10">
            <h2 className='sub-heading'>Tell the whole story</h2>
            <p>If you luck into a free meal or dine as a guest of the restaurant, or have a relevant association with a restaurant or its owners, give full disclosure in your review. We're sure that honesty is the best policy, and other users will respect you even more for it. If you have made it to the major league as a food writer or critic, let us know and we can provide special access for your blog link to appear with your reviews. We love summaries, but incomplete reviews with a manually added link will be removed.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="col-md-10">
            <h2 className='sub-heading'>Be yourself</h2>
            <p>Your profile is your identity on Zomato, so keep it real. You're welcome to use a screen name (foodonym, maybe?), but please refrain from using inappropriate names, bios, or profile images. We want to stay clean, and we might end up removing your account depending on how inappropriate your profile is.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="col-md-10">
            <h2 className='sub-heading'>Don't misrepresent</h2>
            <p>Identifying or promoting yourself as an official Zomato blogger, or using your status to solicit benefits in exchange for reviews on Zomato will not be tolerated. If reports or evidence of such instances are brought to our attention, we reserve the right to delete your Zomato profile, no questions asked.</p>
            <p>If you are a part of Zomato’s influencer program, we will restrict your review activity for the restaurants that you are partnering with, for the program. While we do love your work, letting you review those restaurants will not fit well with the Neutrality guidelines.</p>
            <p>If reports or evidence of threat, misrepresentation or such instances are brought to our attention, we reserve the right to delete your Zomato profile or take any other action that we may deem fit, no questions asked.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="col-md-10">
            <h2 className='sub-heading'>Don’t be a bully</h2>
            <p>We take allegations of blackmail or threatening behaviour against restaurants and its associates very seriously. This activity is strictly against our guidelines and may also be illegal in many locations. Reviews submitted in an attempt to blackmail a restaurant and its associates will be deleted.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="col-md-10">
            <h2 className='sub-heading'>Play by the rules</h2>
            <p>The content you add should be in compliance with Zomato's Terms and Conditions, including terms and conditions of any of Zomato products such as Zomato Pro, Online Ordering, or Zopay, as well as the prevailing local laws and regulations. Local laws take precedence, and content may be moderated or deleted to adhere to these.</p>
